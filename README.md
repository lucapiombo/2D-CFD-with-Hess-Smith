# 2D-CFD-with-Hess-Smith
This project is based on the development of a numerical methodology employing Hess-Smithâ€™s  panel method for the comprehensive analysis of two airfoils arranged in a tandem configuration. The  investigation encompasses the intricate interplay between the airfoils, incorporating considerations  for ground effects. The numerical method is implemented using MATLAB, and subsequent validations are conducted by XFLR5.

The project has been implemented for personal porpuse and has not been yet optimized nor proper organized. Take it as a reference for a panel method developement.
