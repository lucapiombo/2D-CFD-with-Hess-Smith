# 2D-CFD-with-Hess-Smith

This project presents a numerical methodology based on the Hess-Smith panel method for a comprehensive analysis of two airfoils arranged in a tandem configuration. The investigation examines the intricate interplay between the airfoils, including the effects of ground proximity. The numerical method is implemented in MATLAB, and its results are validated using XFLR5.

**Note:**  
This project was developed for personal purposes and has not yet been fully optimized or organized. Please consider it as a reference for panel method development.

## Project Structure

The code is organized into several main scripts corresponding to different cases:
- **Single Airfoil Test:** A simulation for a single airfoil.
- **Tandem Configuration:** A simulation for two airfoils arranged in tandem.
- **Tandem with Ground Effect:** A simulation that also considers the ground effect.
- **Angle of Attack Curves:** Additional scripts to generate angle of attack curves.

## Data Files

Several `.txt` files are provided, directly exported from XFLR5. These files allow you to verify the accuracy of the code by comparing the computed results with the XFLR5 data.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the appropriate main script for the simulation you wish to explore.
