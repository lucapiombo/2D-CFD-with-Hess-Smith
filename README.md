# 2D-CFD-with-Hess-Smith
This project is based on the development of a numerical methodology employing Hess-Smithâ€™s  panel method for the comprehensive analysis of two airfoils arranged in a tandem configuration. The  investigation encompasses the intricate interplay between the airfoils, incorporating considerations  for ground effects. The numerical method is implemented using MATLAB, and subsequent validations are conducted by XFLR5.

The project has been implemented for personal porpuse and has not been yet optimized nor proper organized. Take it as a reference for a panel method developement.

The code is divided in different main for different cases, you have a test for a single airfoil, another of a tandem configuration and the final for the tandem and the ground effect. Finally are provided two additional main for getting the angle of attach curves.

Some .txt files are provided, coming direclty from XFLR5 where you can check the correctness of the code which match the data.
